<h1>Top 3 of Jazzy's Favorite Movies</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Us</h3>
 <p>This chilling movie is the perfect combination of thriller and horror. It's the kind of movie that makes you look over your shoulder when you leave the house.  </p>

<h3>Madea: Homecoming</h3>
<p>There is nothing better than a comedy movie especially when it's directed by Tyler Perry. Madea series will always give you the best laughs and it never gets old no matter how many times you watch it.</p>

<h3>Mcfarland USA</h3>
<p>I'm a sucker for heartfelt stories and Mcfarland hit the spot. As a minority coming from immigrant parents, I have a deep appreciation for those who go the extra mile to achieve their dreams and make sacrifices for their family to build a better life.</p>
